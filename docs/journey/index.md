# The journey of writing a NES emulator in Rust

## Summary
Since I started programming I always wanted to know how emulator works.
> How can a computer let me play the same game that otherwise would require a console like Game Boy, NES, Playstation and so on?

Whenever I would look into the realms of how to write an emulator, I've always found it pretty difficulty to even start (and, to be totally honest, it does require some many SSH - Sitting Studying Hours), so I never did it.

But some time ago, I decided to get into it and understand at least the principles of how it works and how I can write it. This is my journey.
